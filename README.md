I'm a full-stack software developer and technical writer with a love for making things out of code, leather, and yeast who is experienced in and enjoys working across the full product life-cycle from feature design, to implementation.

My tools of the trade are Python, JavaScript, vege tan, and safale us-05.

You can find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/jamaruuuu) and [my website](https://jamalmoir.dev), feel free to say hello!

I like to write to [my blog](https://datadependence.com) about Python, JavaScript, and developer growth.
